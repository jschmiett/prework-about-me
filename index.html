      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I’m one of those weirdos who strikes up conversations with strangers at the grocery store. I value putting others at ease and fostering an environment of teamwork. My friends back in Washington State were excited for me moving to Austin since the friendliness of the people in this area is a good match for my temperament.</p>
      <p>  I have my Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Washington and love talking about STEM with others. In particular, I like Biochemistry, Astrophysics, and have been fascinated by computers since I was a preteen. </p>
      <p>  I found it exhilarating and terrifying to mess around in MSDOS in Junior High. I also found it a fun challenge at that age to figure out how to navigate the family computer solely with a keyboard. By high school I developed a love for doing searches on the internet and experimenting with different structures and vocabulary in my query to see how that impacted the search results I got. In college I was fascinated whenever a coding language was used in the webcomic XKCD and enjoyed trying to decipher the code. Using Excel to analyze data became my favorite part of my lab work. </p>
      <p>  I had been intrigued by coding languages for several years before I started working on learning JavaScript through an app on my phone and realized I found learning and writing code very fulfilling. Since then, I’ve also worked on learning some Python and “baby C”. I think curly braces and semi-colons are adorable.</p>
        
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from the rainy PNW. The cold, damp days created a cozy environment where I enjoyed snuggling up with my laptop and a mug of hot tea.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy knitting, playing Minecraft, having nerdy conversations with my husband, and exercise.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I’m an extroverted introvert who likes the idea of an environment that is a mix of teamwork and working independently. I would like a work environment that values mentorship so that I can always work on growing as a coder, then someday I can also help others to learn and grow as well. 
        Having some flexibility to a work schedule is very attractive to me and I hope to work somewhere where I can work from home when needed. 
        I’d like to have somewhere where I can have my own desk that I can set up for me. 
        </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live 15 minutes north of Cedar Park in Texas. I'm on the edge of Texas Hill Country and enjoy looking out my office window at the tree covered hills.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love how coding makes my brain feel and I’m excited to get to have a job that is intellectually fulfilling to me. I enjoy coding the way I enjoyed doing Trig Calc in college and I would do that just for fun. I like the process of starting at point A and trying to figure out how to get to point B with the pieces you have. It’s a fun puzzle to fit those pieces together, I like that you have to know how they interact with each other, and in the end it becomes this fun adventure to figure out how to make it all work.</p>
      <p> Now that I’m starting to learn coding I find myself looking at the world around me and realizing how much code is involved in daily life, such as texting in a code for a curbside pick up order at the grocery store. As I start noticing more I become more and more curious about things like how a program was structured, what language was used, and how the different components interact together.</p>
      <p>  I’m excited to learn all of this and I’m excited to become involved in this world. I’m looking forward to learning the ins and outs of how my computer works. I love that things in technology are always evolving and changing and there’s always new things to learn. </p>
      <p>  In addition, I have strong written and verbal communication skills that will be a boon in this career path. I’m a nerd myself and I enjoy interacting with other nerds so I feel like I would be a good fit socially as well.</p>
